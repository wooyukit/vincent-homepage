# [WOO Yu Kit Vincent Homepage](https://vincent-homepage.web.app/)

Thanks for [craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage) who is Full stack developer from Japan.

My portfolio Webpage by following his great tutorial in [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSMZgXzC9AA). It is better to follow his tutor video and type with him rather than just directly download and modify his source. It is a great execise to learn next.js.

The webpage is mainly using Next.js, Chakra UI framework and blender with Three.js. It is a good practice by following his tutorial.

I was using `next export` to build static pages and deplay to public via firebase hosting. The whole development and deployment processes are very smooth. Enjoy!
